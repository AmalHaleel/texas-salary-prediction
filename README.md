 Texas Salary Prediction

This project predicts the annual salary of Texas state employees using Machine Learning.  
Data cleaning, feature engineering (`Is_Manager`, date split), and preprocessing pipelines were applied.  
Models used: **Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost**.  

**Results:** Random Forest & Linear Regression gave the best performance (~90% RÂ²).  
**Challenges:** handling missing values, date parsing, outliers, and feature selection.  

The project highlights salary prediction and wage disparity analysis across departments.
